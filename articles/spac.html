            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a unique type of legal entity which does not have any “real” business operations like a normal company. SPACs are formed with the intent of eventually acquiring another company, usually through a leveraged buyout or cash, and once a company is acquired, a SPAC normally executes a reverse merger which allows the acquired company to take over the SPAC and operate within its legal shell, on the public markets. The SPACs name generally changes to the acquired company’s name and the stock symbol under which it trades usually changes to reflect the new company’s symbol (e.g., DEAC to DKNG, and SCH to SPCE). </p>


            <h3>Funding</h3>

            <p>SPACs acquire companies using funds raised through its IPO. The IPO funds are placed into a trust and cannot be used for any purpose, other than to perform an acquisition, but in some cases, the interest earned on the money in the trust can be used by the SPAC to aid its search pre-acquisition (increased buying power). SPACs generally have a deadline (usually 2 years) by which they must acquire another company or liquidate and return their IPO proceeds to shareholders. Once a target has been established, shareholders of a SPAC vote on the acquisition and if it passes, the acquisition and reverse merger are executed.</p>

            <h3>Acquisition Target</h3>

            <p>In most cases, SPACs are formed by experts in a certain industry or field and therefore are developed with the intention of acquiring a company in that industry or field (sometimes an acquisition target has already been identified but SPAC founders usually do not disclose that information). However, SPACs are not legally limited to a certain industry or sector for their acquisition target. This gives management a lot of flexibility when looking for a target, but also increases risk for shareholders as they may not have great insight into what types of companies the SPAC may be looking into. </p>


            <h3 id="IPO">Initial Public Offering</h3>

               <p>SPACs IPO by selling “units” (usually at $10 a unit). Each unit consists of a certain number of shares of the SPAC and a certain number of out of the money warrants (usually at a $11.50 strike price). Warrants are exactly like call options, except when exercised - when warrants are exercised, the shares bought come from the company itself, not a different investor. Warrants can also have a much further expiry period than call options (often 5+ years). Warrants have much less volatility than call options as well, and you will generally see around a $1 movement in a warrant for every $1 movement of the stock. (Although, since warrants are priced lower than the stock, they typically gain/lose more on a percent basis than the stock).</p>


            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>When considering an investment into a SPAC, make sure you are aware of: 
                <ol>
                <li>The SPAC’s target (if one has been announced)</li>
                <li>The current share price vs the IPO price</li>
                <li>The conversion ratio if / when the acquisition is completed (the number of shares of the new combined company you will own for every share of the SPAC you own).</li>
                </ol>
                
                Information on SPACs is not easy to find and is often misrepresented, even for those few SPACs that are generating a lot of attention (such as DEAC before Draftkings), so we recommend looking at the company’s SEC filings as a source of truth. Investing in a SPAC is usually very risky unless done with great care and lots of research beforehand. However, the opportunities to profit with a SPAC investment can be very lucrative if timed right and analyzed well.
